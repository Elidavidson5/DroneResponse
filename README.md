## Abstract — 
Across California, the number of wildfires burning 10,000 acres or more has consistently increased over the past two decades, with ten of the 20 largest wildfires between 1950 and 2023 occurring in 2020 and 2021, and all but two since 2000. Current solutions for detecting and responding to such wildfires, such as helicopters, are cost-inefficient, prone to human error, and lack the ability to cover large areas effectively. 
This research project aims to develop a Situational Awareness Response Drone, HiloScope, to address these challenges by providing a scalable and cost-efficient alternative. 


## Project Overview / Background
	HiloScope aims to present an innovative design on how emergencies are handled by providing a cost-effective and practical alternative to helicopters and traditional rapid response teams. Rather than relying on expensive and outdated systems, HiloScope deploys a fleet of drones designed to save lives and resources. These drones use powerful machine learning algorithms like OpenCV, PyTorch, and TensorFlow to detect people, animals, and fires through the onboard Waveshare thermal camera. Once a detection occurs, the drones send real-time updates to an online monitoring system, giving emergency teams the information they need to act quickly and effectively.


The project includes every stage of development—from designing and prototyping to manufacturing and rigorous testing—to ensure the drones are dependable and scalable. By reducing the need for human intervention in hazardous conditions, HiloScope streamlines emergency responses, protects property, and, most importantly, saves lives. With a target production cost of just $1000 per drone, this system offers a smart, accessible solution to the increasing demand for faster and more efficient disaster management tools.


## Objectives
The primary goal of the HiloScope initiative is to save lives, reduce costs, and enhance response times during emergencies. By applying lessons learned from existing drone technologies and machine learning applications, the team will explore how to improve these systems while testing the capabilities of the Waveshare thermal camera. The project emphasizes precision, accuracy, and durability, aiming to deliver a global deployment solution for disaster response.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
Starts backend server localhost:4000

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run most-date`

Installs python requirements npm installs



### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
